## Hello There!

Welcome to my blog =)! Writing a blog always sounded interesting to me, so I finally jumped at the opportunity to. This blog is created using Jekyll and Lanyon and is hosted by Github Pages. I wanted something that was simple, but also required some programming/dev knowledge. I came across Jekyll and decided to give it a whirl. This is my own spin on the countless of other Jekyll-powered blogs that exist out in the world wide web. I'll treat this as my own brain dump (please excuse the engineering term) for my thoughts, passions, explorations, and new adventures in life. This space is mostly for me to maintain my committment to living a fulfilling life, but you're most definitely welcome to join me! (And no this is not an April Fool's Joke)
